# üå§Ô∏è The Worlds Simplest Weather App üå§Ô∏è
## Minimal and simplistic

This is the Simplest Weather App, a very straightforward user-friendly app that brings weather forcasts right to your fingertips. It is inspired by the sleek design of iOS. This application is made to be as simple to use as possible. Weather fetched from [open-meteo API](https://open-meteo.com).

Simple 3 step process to search:
1. Search by typing in the name of the city of your choice.
1. From the search results, select the city of your choice.
1. Once clicked on, the app immediately displays the current weather for that city along with the 7-day forecast. It's that simple!

## Feature
Enjoy a scenic background of nature as you use the application. If you don‚Äôt particularly fancy a certain background, just refresh the page to be introduced to a new background.
